structure your commit message like this:

```
[type] [optional scope]: [description]

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

Each commit has a type that directly matches semantic versioning practices:

- fix: patches a bug in our codebase
- feat: introduces a new feature in our codebase
- refactor!: introduces a breaking API change by refactoring because of the “!” symbol

Some other Angular’s type suggestions are: “build:”, “chore:”, “ci:”, “docs:”, “style:”, “refactor:”, “perf:”, “test:”, and others
