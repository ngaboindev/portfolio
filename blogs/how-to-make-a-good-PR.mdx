Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub.
Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.

More here : <a href='https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests' target='__blank'>docs.github.com</a>

## Why it's important

The best written pull request speeds up the code reviewing , because the best way we present our code for code review ,
the more likely the code reviewer will easily review and speeds up the code review process.

### Template

It's simple to set up a template that you and your team members can use to create the standard PR. And if you and your team are using
version control like GitHub , it's easy to setup the template that can be injected in the description of every pull request created.

## What?
I've added support for authentication to implement Key Result 2 of OKR1. It includes model, table, controller and test. For more background, see ticket
#JIRA-123.
## Why?
These changes complete the user login and account creation experience. See #JIRA-123 for more information.
## How?
This includes a migration, model and controller for user authentication. I'm using Devise to do the heavy lifting. I ran Devise migrations and those are included here.
## Screenshots (optional)

## Anything Else?
Let's consider using a 3rd party authentication provider for this, to offload MFA and other considerations as they arise and as the privacy landscape evolves. AWS Cognito is a good option, so is Firebase. I'm happy to start researching this path. Let's also consider breaking this out into its own service. We can then re-use it or share the accounts with other apps in the future.
