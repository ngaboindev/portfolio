In January of 2021, I started blogging using HashNode simply because I was documenting my journey of 100 days of code challenge learning python programming. after writing only 2 blogs I failed miserably to continue my 100 days coding challenge and after all, I even quit my writing habits.

## Starting Over

Now, It's May 2022 and I want to push myself to start again to write some blogs where I will write mostly about frontend development and web development in general. I'm dedicating myself to at least releasing one article per week, where I'll be talking about what I've learned or just sharing tips & tricks that I've discovered.

so wish me luck ðŸ¤—!
